Her mother, though, thinks he's a little shopwornâhe's even missing a button! Still, Corduroy knows that with a bit of work he can tidy himself up and be just the bear for Lisa. And where better to start than with a quick search through the department store for a new button!Corduroy, with his unaffected simplicity and childlike emotion, is one of the best-loved bears in children's books. His story has become an irresistible childhood classic, as basic and appealing as a small bear's desire for a home and a friend and the perfect fulfillment found in the devotion of a young girl.Don Freemanwas born in San Diego, California, and moved to New York City to study art, making his living as a jazz trumpeter. With this loss of his trumpet on a subway train, Mr. Freeman turned his talents to art full-time. In the 1940s he began writing and illustrating children's books; his many popular titles includeBeady Bear,Dandelion,Mop Top,Norman the Doorman,and his follow-up toCorduroy,A Pocket For Corduroy.At the time of his death in 1978, theLos Angeles Timeswrote:"Ingeniousness and humor, theatricality and commonality, humanity and beauty: these elements survive in his picture books."Edition MSRP: U.S. $16â¹â¹ / CAN. $21â°â°(ISBN 978-0-670-24133-0)Reinforced Binding.

What could the children do but let her in? But what a low voice she had, what thorny hands, and what a hairy face!The Chinese tale of Lon Po Po, Granny Wolf, like the European tale of Little Red Riding Hood, comes from an ancient oral tradition and is thought to be over a thousand years old. It is a favorite tale of artist Ed young, who translated and illustrated this version. Using a dramatic style that combines techniques used in ancient Chinese panel art with a powerful contemporary palette or watercolors and pastels, Mr. Young has created a book of classic beauty and charm.Ed Youngwas born in Tientsin, China, grew up in Shanghai, and brings his Eastern heritage to his artwork. From the authentic Oriental papercut technique ofThe Emperor and the Kiteto the rich and glowing pastels ofYeh Shin,Mr. Young attains a versatility of feeling, theme, and style.Cats are Cats,his much lauded collaboration with anthologist Nancy Larrick, was named one of the Ten Best Illustrated Children's Books of 1988 as well as an ALA Notable Book for Children.1990 Caldecott Medal WinnerEdition MSRP: $16â¹â¹ USA / $25âµâ° CAN(ISBN 0-399-21619-7)Show more",num_reviews:"1313.0",ISBN:"9780399216190.0",pub_date:"November 1, 1989",pub_year:"1989",publisher:"Philomel Books",decade:"1980.0",animal_group:"wolf"},{goodreads_link:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1129315.The_Berenstain_Bears_Trouble_at_School",animal:"bear",pronoun:"he/him",pronoun_extra:"",pronoun_group:"he/him",animal_book_rank:"33",num_ratings:"17469",title:"The Berenstain Bears' Trouble at School",author:"Stan Berenstain",decade_category:"1980s",manual_rank:"",avg_ratings:"4.21",book_cover_image:"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344369313i/1129315.jpg",description:"Get ready to go back to school with the Berenstain Bears!

The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason."Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His"wonderful, awful"idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.Show more`,num_reviews:"4729.0",ISBN:"9780007173044.0",pub_date:"October 12, 1957",pub_year:"1957",publisher:"Harper Collins Children's Books",decade:"1950.0",animal_group:"dog"},{goodreads_link:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7779.Horton_Hears_a_Who_",animal:"elephant",pronoun:"he/him",pronoun_extra:"",pronoun_group:"he/him",animal_book_rank:"4",num_ratings:"110590",title:"Horton Hears a Who!",author:"Dr. Seuss",decade_category:"1950s",manual_rank:"",avg_ratings:"4.21",book_cover_image:"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327924655i/7779.jpg",description:"Horton the kindly elephant has his work cut out saving the tiny Whos who live on a speck of dust â no one else believes they are there!

One day on a walk through Paris (a "twelve little girls in two straight lines" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, "But for a dog / That kept its head," saving her from a "watery grave." What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the "old house in Paris that was covered with vines," and kicks Genevieve out on the street. Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: "They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same." As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

Chaucer told the story with vigorous rhythm and singing words; Barbara Cooney has adapted it for chidlren and illustrated it with pictures as handsome as a medieval herbal.Chanticleer was a merry rooster, "His comb was redder than fine coral and turreted like a castle wall, his bill was black and shone like jet, and his feathers were like burnished gold." He had seven hens, the fairest of which was Partlet.It was a great joy to hear them sing together. But one night a sorrowful event overtook them. A fox, tipped with black, and full of sly wickedness, burst through the hedge into the yard where Chanticleer and his wives were in the habit of going. The fox was clever, but he met his match in the rooster.Barbara Cooney's pictures are the most beautiful this gifted artist has ever drawn.

At first, big sister Lilly thought it might be fun to have a new baby in the family. But when her parents repeatedly coo, "Julius is the baby of world," Lilly's mouse hackles begin to rise. Soon the jealousy is too much for her, and she embarks on a rejection campaign that is hysterically funny, but also comforting for siblings who probably feel just as much resentment but would never go to Lilly's extremes. Kevin Henkes, creator ofLilly's Purple Plastic Purserefuses to shy away from the truly powerful and sometimes dark feelings of children. Through bright watercolors and handwritten, cartoon-style dialogue, Henkes relishes Lilly's wickedness. For example, she delights in insulting her oblivious baby brother: "If you were a food, you'd be a raisin," she whispers into his crib. "If you were a number you'd be zero." When she paints an elaborate family portrait, she leaves Julius out. When she throws a tea party, guess which baby doesn't get an invitation? But when a visiting cousin starts insulting baby Julius, we discover that the flip side of Lilly's intense jealousy is an even more powerful and lasting loyalty.
