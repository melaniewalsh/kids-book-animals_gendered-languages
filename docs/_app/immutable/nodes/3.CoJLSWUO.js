We collected information about books that were either *tagged* the most as a “picture book” on Goodreads or compiled into a *list* of well-known picture books by decade on Goodreads. We then supplemented this data with picture books that appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for children’s picture books (between June 2008 when the list started and August 2024 when we collected data) and picture books that were tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database at Miami University."},{"type":"text","value":"To identify picture books that specifically feature animals, we then selected any picture book that had “animals” as one of its top Goodreads tags; any picture book that was tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description — see example prompt and response below). We manually evaluate each book and each representation of animals, and we use the above criteria as a culling method for reducing a large dataset to a manageable size. We also excluded anthologies and collections, such as Grimm’s Fairy Tales."},{"type":"text","value":"For our manual evaluation, we identified an animal as anthropomorphic if 1) **the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or is an important character to the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (**e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in house, etc.). We excluded animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, “… said the birds”, “the squirrels jumped”); other exclusions…."},{"type":"text","value":"We identified the gender of the animal based on the pronouns used to refer to the animal in the text of the picture book: she/her; he/him; they/them; it; [animal name]; n/a. In some cases, animals were not referred to by pronouns, but they were described using gendered honorifics (e.g., Ms. Eel, Mr. Camel) or gendered familial relations (mother, sister, father, brother). In these cases, we tagged the animal with the common gender associated with the honorific or familial role in a human context (e.g., \\"Ms.\\" as female, \\"father\\" as male), while recognizing that these associations are culturally specific and may not reflect the full diversity of gender identities. We acknowledge that these choices impose human-centric and binary gender norms onto characters that might otherwise be interpreted with more flexibility or ambiguity."},{"type":"text","value":"Add a note about the minimal animal grouping that we did: cat and kitten, dog and puppy, bunny, rabbit, hare.
