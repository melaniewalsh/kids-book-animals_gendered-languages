What began as, let’s face it, a kind of random symbolic association steadily became, over multiple centuries of a big game of “telephone,” the ladybug’s gendered destiny in many parts of the human world. So while language definitely shapes how we view animals and the world around us, there are other powerful forces at work, too. Like those historical big guns: religion and empire."}]},{"section":"weird","content":[{"type":"h2","value":"Weirder, Wilder, Less Predictable"},{"type":"text","value":"The arbitrariness of our gendered associations with certain animals, like the ladybug, is kind of inspiring in its own weird way. Sure, it’s shocking and a little depressing to realize just how much our mental maps are shaped by British colonists and Catholic iconography from 400 years ago. But it also means those maps can be redrawn."},{"type":"text","value":"Things aren’t going to change overnight. In our analysis, we found no clear progress toward equal gender representation in animal characters from 1950 to today. And when I asked Fulcher if things might be improving, she didn’t mince words: “No.” Her lab recently found that gendered traits in toys have barely budged in the past 30 years, so it wasn’t surprising that books reflected the same stagnation."},{"type":"text","value":"As she reminded us, it takes time to move the needle: “Parents provide books to kids that may be new or old so it will take a minute to trickle into kids’ lives even if the gap disappears today.”"},{"type":"text","value":"Still, while broad patterns haven’t shifted, we did find plenty of meaningful exceptions. Take pigs, for example. In the mid- and late-twentieth century, pigs were more commonly coded as male—thanks in part to iconic characters like the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf."},{"type":"text","value":"But by the late 1990s and early 2000s, pigs took a strong feminine turn. Think of Laura Joffe Numeroff’s If You Give a Pig a Pancake (1998), Ian Falconer’s Olivia (2000), or Mo Willems’s Elephant & Piggie series, where pig characters are not only female but confident, curious, and central to their stories."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"What’s more, there are thousands of kid’s books that are not in our dataset. We focus here on the very most popular books, but a lot of parents intentionally seek out books beyond the mainstream—typically the most conservative cultural sector and the slowest to change. Outside the spotlight, in indie and lesser-known titles, animal characters are hopefully getting weirder, wilder, and less predictable."},{"type":"text","value":"That’s still one advantage we have over large language models. We have the power to change our own training data."}]},{"section":"methods","content":[{"type":"h2","value":"Data and Methods"},{"type":"text","value":"To identify picture books from the last 100+ years that feature anthropomorphic animals, we first compiled a general dataset of picture books, emphasizing picture books that have been popular among readers in the 21st century. We collected information about books that were either *tagged* the most as a “picture book” on Goodreads or compiled into a *list* of well-known picture books by decade on Goodreads. We then supplemented this data with picture books that appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for children’s picture books (between June 2008 when the list started and August 2024 when we collected data) and picture books that were tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database at Miami University."},{"type":"text","value":"To identify picture books that specifically feature animals, we then selected any picture book that had “animals” as one of its top Goodreads tags; any picture book that was tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description — see example prompt and response below). We manually evaluate each book and each representation of animals, and we use the above criteria as a culling method for reducing a large dataset to a manageable size. We also excluded anthologies and collections, such as Grimm’s Fairy Tales."},{"type":"text","value":"For our manual evaluation, we identified an animal as anthropomorphic if 1) **the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or is an important character to the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (**e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in house, etc.). We excluded animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, “… said the birds”, “the squirrels jumped”); other exclusions…."},{"type":"text","value":"We identified the gender of the animal based on the pronouns used to refer to the animal in the text of the picture book: she/her; he/him; they/them; it; [animal name]; n/a. In some cases, animals were not referred to by pronouns, but they were described using gendered honorifics (e.g., Ms. Eel, Mr. Camel) or gendered familial relations (mother, sister, father, brother). In these cases, we tagged the animal with the common gender associated with the honorific or familial role in a human context (e.g., \\"Ms.\\" as female, \\"father\\" as male), while recognizing that these associations are culturally specific and may not reflect the full diversity of gender identities. We acknowledge that these choices impose human-centric and binary gender norms onto characters that might otherwise be interpreted with more flexibility or ambiguity."},{"type":"text","value":"Add a note about the minimal animal grouping that we did: cat and kitten, dog and puppy, bunny, rabbit, hare.
