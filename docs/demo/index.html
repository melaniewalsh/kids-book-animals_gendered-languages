How often was a character’s gender left ambiguous?"},{"type":"text","value":"In the children’s books, gender neutral language was rare. Only two percent of the animals were described as “it,” and “they” was almost never used. About 20% of the characters were referred to simply by their animal name (e.g., “the frog”)."},{"type":"text","value":"There was a lot more gender neutrality and ambiguity in the human survey responses and LLM results (though, since their stories were much shorter than a typical kid’s book, it was perhaps easier to use/maintain gender neutrality).

And why are female animal characters even more absent in the stories produced by our survey respondents and the AI model?"},{"type":"text","value":"Perhaps because the main character of a story is still assumed to be male by default—and maybe especially when the story’s setting lacks explicit social cues."},{"type":"text","value":"This aligns with decades of research showing that male characters dominate children’s literature and media.[1] A 2011 study found that gender disparity was actually worse for animal protagonists than for human protagonists. While representation of girls and women improved for human main characters over time, the animal world remained stubbornly male-dominated—at a ratio of about 2 to 1, similar to our findings."},{"type":"text","value":"The male skew may be even more exaggerated than it appears. That’s because gender-neutral animal characters—those never explicitly gendered in the text—are often assumed to be male, too. In a classic 1987 study, mothers reading aloud to their children referred to ungendered animal characters as male 95% of the time. One of the only feminine designations in the study was for a duck pictured with two ducklings—“Mrs. Duck.” Though we didn’t keep track of the roles that characters played in stories, we similarly observed that many female animals were moms and sisters, background characters for male leads."},{"type":"text","value":"There’s a kind of stealth sexism at work here. Because animal characters seem less connected to the human world, creators think they’re sidestepping pesky human problems. This idea has persisted in children’s publishing circles for decades."},{"type":"text","value":"Back in the 1970s, one children’s book editor told researchers that animal characters just make things “easier”: “You don’t have to determine if it’s a girl or boy—right? That’s such a problem today.” Decades later, Marcia Wernick, the agent to children’s book author Mo Willems, echoed the same logic:  “Anthropomorphized characters have always been in the forefront of children’s books because they enable the creator to not have to make decisions about is this a tall or short, black or white… character.”"},{"type":"text","value":"But our findings suggest that when we turn to animals, that’s often when we most faithfully reproduce, and even exaggerate, the cultural norms we think we’ve left behind."},{"type":"text","value":"Feather Flores, an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster Children’s Publishing, told us that the idea of “universal” animal characters can be powerful but also problematic. “[A]nthropomorphized animals can be extremely useful as a vehicle for fable, allegory, satire, or social commentary,” she said, especially in “periods of social and political unrest” when free speech and critiques of power are threatened."},{"type":"text","value":"But Flores says that when animal characters are used to stand in for children—or to symbolically represent complex human experiences—it would often be better to just represent human children and those experiences directly. “Attempting to build relatability or universality by stripping away the ways we are embodied and experience the world as humans does not always (or, I would argue, usually) make for the most emotionally resonant stories.”"},{"type":"text","value":"Emotionally resonant stories are one thing. But beyond literary merits, is the absence of girl animals in kid’s books really that serious? Does it actually impact how kids develop and see the world?"},{"type":"text","value":"Yes, says Megan Fulcher, a professor of cognitive and behavior psychology at Washington &amp; Lee University, who focuses on gender role development and toy play in children. “Differences in representation really matter no matter if characters are human or animals,” Fulcher said. This absence not only provides girls with few models, but it also prevents boys from practicing cognitive skills like empathy, from having the opportunity to “think about what it’s like to be someone else."},{"type":"text","value":"Fulcher and her lab have found the same problem in kid’s toys. “Boy toys” like action figures and Legos often include few or no female characters, which makes “women and girls invisible in boys’ pretend play” and leaves their imaginative worlds “void of girls.” This matters because imaginative play is crucial for developing relational skills and empathy."},{"type":"text","value":"If we apply this logic to picture books, the picture is rather bleak. Because animal characters don’t just obscure girls and women, they obscure all kinds of human difference. For example, a UK study found that there were more animal protagonists in British kid’s books than there were Black, Asian, or ethnic minority human protagonists. And recently, animal characters have been used to represent transgender people and their experiences, which Parrish Turner argues can fall flat or worse: “[T]here is a marked difference between wanting to be another gender, considering the range and complexity of human gender, and wanting to be another species, something that is impossible.”"},{"type":"text","value":"So much for sidestepping human problems. Animal characters don’t just reflect our biases—they often deepen them."}]},{"section":"ladies","content":[{"type":"h2","value":"Why are cats, birds, and ladybugs… ladies?"},{"type":"text","value":"But if animal characters are assumed to be male by default, that still leaves a deeper question. Why do we gender certain animals in certain ways more than others—like cats and birds as female, or bears, wolves, dogs, and frogs as male?"},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"It’s likely the result of a rich and long-simmering cultural soup: a mix of projected human stereotypes, symbolic associations, hard-coded linguistic habits, and famous media characters, with just a sprinkling of historical quirks to taste."},{"type":"text","value":"Large, strong animals like bears and wolves are often coded as masculine, while small, delicate animals like birds or kittens are more easily read as feminine. Frogs are slimy, loud, and gross… kind of like boys?"},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"There are also countless folk tales, stories, and cultural metaphors that connect certain animals with gender, some of them dating back hundreds or thousands of years."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"While of course there are famous boy cats—think Garfield, Felix, Puss in Boots—cats have been linked to femininity for a long time. They were linked to goddesses in ancient Egypt, to witches in medieval Europe, and more recently to figures like the lonely “cat lady” and the now TikTok famous “black cat girlfriend”—a term for a standoffish, introverted, sometimes mean girlfriend who is best paired with a “golden retriever” partner."},{"type":"text","value":"(tiktok)"},{"type":"text","value":"Birds, too, carry associations with femininity. You can think of the caged bird as a metaphor for constrained womanhood, or all the women who get transformed into birds in Greek mythology."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"These animalistic analogies sometimes get embedded into the slang and colloquialisms we use everyday, even across languages like English and Spanish. As scholar Irene López Rodríguez reminds us, we call men “studs, bucks, wolves, toros (bulls), zorros (foxes) and linces (lynxes),” and we call women “chick, bird, kitten, pollita (chicken) or gatita (kitten).” “The choice of the animal name does not seem arbitrary,” she says, “but, on the contrary, may shed some light onto the expectations and beliefs society holds about males and females.”"},{"type":"text","value":"Thinking beyond English also raises an important question: Does language influence how we perceive the gender of animals?"},{"type":"text","value":"Some languages, like Spanish or French, have grammatical gender, where all nouns are gendered, even inanimate ones like “la mesa” (the table). In Spanish, many animals can be either masculine or feminine, such as the cat—el gato or la gata. But others, like the frog—la rana—are always grammatically feminine."},{"type":"text","value":"So are Spanish speakers more likely to perceive frogs as girls?"},{"type":"text","value":"Though we’d need another study to know for sure, some research suggests: maybe? There are definitely Spanish children’s books with girl frogs in starring roles—like Olga de Dios’s Rana de Tres Ojos or Mar Benegas’s La Rana Mariana busca toda la semana."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"But Spanish speakers also find creative ways to work around grammatical gender. The famous Muppets character Kermit the Frog is masculinized through the addition of a traditionally male name—La Rana René in Mexico and Latin America, or La Rana Gustavo in Spain. And the Spanish translation of Frog and Toad Are Friends uses a totally made up word, sepo—Sapo y Sepo son Amigos—to describe the iconic frog in slacks and distinguish him from his sapo (toad) bestie. Still, it might not be a coincidence that both these examples are already famous male frogs imported from English."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"Ladybugs are another intriguing case. Ladybugs appear in four different books in our dataset, and are gendered female 75% of the time. Are ladybugs “ladies” in all languages?"},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"Surprisingly, in many of them, yes. In the English language, the word ladybird—that’s what the Brits call ladybugs—and ladycow, another common term, originated around the 1600s. “Lady” was a reference to “Our Lady,” the Virgin Mary, apparently because both the beetle and the Holy Mother like to wear red. Ladybugs were also considered somewhat holy because they devour the pests that plague farmers and gardeners (yes, they’re carnivores)."},{"type":"text","value":"The name spread—likely alongside colonialism. In The History of the Ladybird: With Some Diversions of This and That (1989), A.W. Exell documents 329 names for ladybugs in 55 languages. A full quarter of them are linked to the Virgin Mary."},{"type":"text","value":"(chart)"},{"type":"text","value":"In German, the ladybug is Marienkäfer (“Mary’s beetle”); in Spanish, Mariquita (“little Mary”); in Norwegian and Danish, Mariahøne and Mariehøne respectively (“Mary’s hen”); in Italian, regional names include la gallinella della Madonna (“Madonna’s little hen”); in Macedonian, kalinka na Bogorodica (“ladybug of the Virgin Mary”); and in Icelandic, Maríubjalla (“Mary’s bell”). Weirdly, many other ladybug names have religious connotations, like “God’s little cow,” which appears in Russian (bozhya korovka) and Polish (boża krówka)."},{"type":"text","value":"This reveals how the gendering of animals can be both arbitrary and deeply culturally ingrained. What began as, let’s face it, a kind of random symbolic association steadily became, over multiple centuries of a big game of “telephone,” the ladybug’s gendered destiny in many parts of the human world. So while language definitely shapes how we view animals and the world around us, there are other powerful forces at work, too. Like those historical big guns: religion and empire."}]},{"section":"weird","content":[{"type":"h2","value":"Weirder, Wilder, Less Predictable"},{"type":"text","value":"The arbitrariness of our gendered associations with certain animals, like the ladybug, is kind of inspiring in its own weird way. Sure, it’s shocking and a little depressing to realize just how much our mental maps are shaped by British colonists and Catholic iconography from 400 years ago. But it also means those maps can be redrawn."},{"type":"text","value":"Things aren’t going to change overnight. In our analysis, we found no clear progress toward equal gender representation in animal characters from 1950 to today. And when I asked Fulcher if things might be improving, she didn’t mince words: “No.” Her lab recently found that gendered traits in toys have barely budged in the past 30 years, so it wasn’t surprising that books reflected the same stagnation."},{"type":"text","value":"As she reminded us, it takes time to move the needle: “Parents provide books to kids that may be new or old so it will take a minute to trickle into kids’ lives even if the gap disappears today.”"},{"type":"text","value":"Still, while broad patterns haven’t shifted, we did find plenty of meaningful exceptions. Take pigs, for example. In the mid- and late-twentieth century, pigs were more commonly coded as male—thanks in part to iconic characters like the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf."},{"type":"text","value":"But by the late 1990s and early 2000s, pigs took a strong feminine turn. Think of Laura Joffe Numeroff’s If You Give a Pig a Pancake (1998), Ian Falconer’s Olivia (2000), or Mo Willems’s Elephant &amp; Piggie series, where pig characters are not only female but confident, curious, and central to their stories."},{"type":"text","value":"(img)"},{"type":"text","value":"What’s more, there are thousands of kid’s books that are not in our dataset. We focus here on the very most popular books, but a lot of parents intentionally seek out books beyond the mainstream—typically the most conservative cultural sector and the slowest to change. Outside the spotlight, in indie and lesser-known titles, animal characters are hopefully getting weirder, wilder, and less predictable."},{"type":"text","value":"That’s still one advantage we have over large language models. We have the power to change our own training data."}]},{"section":"methods","content":[{"type":"h2","value":"Data and Methods"},{"type":"text","value":"To identify picture books from the last 100+ years that feature anthropomorphic animals, we first compiled a general dataset of picture books, emphasizing picture books that have been popular among readers in the 21st century. We collected information about books that were either *tagged* the most as a “picture book” on Goodreads or compiled into a *list* of well-known picture books by decade on Goodreads. We then supplemented this data with picture books that appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for children’s picture books (between June 2008 when the list started and August 2024 when we collected data) and picture books that were tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database at Miami University."},{"type":"text","value":"To identify picture books that specifically feature animals, we then selected any picture book that had “animals” as one of its top Goodreads tags; any picture book that was tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description — see example prompt and response below). We manually evaluate each book and each representation of animals, and we use the above criteria as a culling method for reducing a large dataset to a manageable size. We also excluded anthologies and collections, such as Grimm’s Fairy Tales."},{"type":"text","value":"For our manual evaluation, we identified an animal as anthropomorphic if 1) **the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or is an important character to the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (**e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in house, etc.). We excluded animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, “… said the birds”, “the squirrels jumped”); other exclusions…."},{"type":"text","value":"We identified the gender of the animal based on the pronouns used to refer to the animal in the text of the picture book: she/her; he/him; they/them; it; [animal name]; n/a. In some cases, animals were not referred to by pronouns, but they were described using gendered honorifics (e.g., Ms. Eel, Mr. Camel) or gendered familial relations (mother, sister, father, brother).

Across all the children’s books, only a few animals were more consistently female than male: birds, ducks, and cats.

Male animal characters appeared twice as often as female characters across all the children’s books (50% male vs. 25% female references). They appeared nearly three times as often in the survey results (39% vs. 14%)—particularly striking because our respondents were mostly women—and eleven times as often in the AI-generated stories (11% vs. 1%).<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(cycle)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->“She/her” appeared in just 36 LLM-generated stories out of 2,400, and mostly in the outputs that were set to be more “random.” There were zero female animal characters at the most predictable temperature setting.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But what about animal characters who were presented as non-binary or not gendered at all? How often was a character’s gender left ambiguous?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->In the children’s books, gender neutral language was rare. Only two percent of the animals were described as “it,” and “they” was almost never used. About 20% of the characters were referred to simply by their animal name (e.g., “the frog”).<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->There was a lot more gender neutrality and ambiguity in the human survey responses and LLM results (though, since their stories were much shorter than a typical kid’s book, it was perhaps easier to use/maintain gender neutrality). While “he/him” was still the most frequently used pronoun in the survey results (39%), many respondents referred to the animal by name (26%) or by “it” (17%).<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(chart)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->The LLM leaned into neutrality even more heavily. The model’s most commonly used referent—by far—was “it,” used in 72% of completions!<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->This result surprised us. We expected an LLM like GPT-4o—which is trained on millions of human-authored documents, including Wikipedia articles, social media posts, and surely thousands of children’s books—to reflect, or even exaggerate, dominant cultural gender patterns (or at least dominant Western cultural patterns, given the likely training data). Instead, the model stood apart from both the books and the survey respondents.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Why would ChatGPT describe an anthropomorphized animal as “it” so often?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Our best guess is that OpenAI intentionally steers its models toward neutral pronouns in cases where gender is ambiguous, attempting to address the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07187 target=_blank rel=noreferrer>well-documented</a> and <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462536 target=_blank rel=noreferrer>deep-seated</a> <a href=https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/generative-ai-unesco-study-reveals-alarming-evidence-regressive-gender-stereotypes target=_blank rel=noreferrer>gender biases</a> evidenced in AI models. But our experiment shows that these well-meaning guardrails may have unintended consequences. By defaulting to “it,” the model doesn’t just neutralize gender; it virtually erases the possibility of a female protagonist altogether.<!----></p><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></section><section id="where"><!--[!--><!--[--><!--[2--><!----><h2><!---->Where did all the girl animals go?<!----><!----></h2><!----><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Why are animal gender ratios so skewed in kid’s books, with few obvious signs of improving—at least among these ultra popular books? And why are female animal characters even more absent in the stories produced by our survey respondents and the AI model?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Perhaps because the main character of a story is still assumed to be male by default—and maybe especially when the story’s setting lacks explicit social cues.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->This aligns with decades of research showing that male characters dominate children’s literature and media.[1] A 2011 study found that gender disparity was actually worse for animal protagonists than for human protagonists. While representation of girls and women improved for human main characters over time, the animal world remained stubbornly male-dominated—at a ratio of about 2 to 1, similar to our findings.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->The male skew may be even more exaggerated than it appears. That’s because gender-neutral animal characters—those never explicitly gendered in the text—are often assumed to be male, too. In a classic 1987 study, mothers reading aloud to their children referred to ungendered animal characters as male 95% of the time. One of the only feminine designations in the study was for a duck pictured with two ducklings—“Mrs. Duck.” Though we didn’t keep track of the roles that characters played in stories, we similarly observed that many female animals were moms and sisters, background characters for male leads.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->There’s a kind of stealth sexism at work here. Because animal characters seem less connected to the human world, creators think they’re sidestepping pesky human problems. This idea has persisted in children’s publishing circles for decades.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Back in the 1970s, one children’s book editor told researchers that animal characters just make things “easier”: “You don’t have to determine if it’s a girl or boy—right? That’s such a problem today.” Decades later, Marcia Wernick, the agent to children’s book author Mo Willems, echoed the same logic:  “Anthropomorphized characters have always been in the forefront of children’s books because they enable the creator to not have to make decisions about is this a tall or short, black or white… character.”<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But our findings suggest that when we turn to animals, that’s often when we most faithfully reproduce, and even exaggerate, the cultural norms we think we’ve left behind.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Feather Flores, an editor at Simon & Schuster Children’s Publishing, told us that the idea of “universal” animal characters can be powerful but also problematic. “[A]nthropomorphized animals can be extremely useful as a vehicle for fable, allegory, satire, or social commentary,” she said, especially in “periods of social and political unrest” when free speech and critiques of power are threatened.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But Flores says that when animal characters are used to stand in for children—or to symbolically represent complex human experiences—it would often be better to just represent human children and those experiences directly. “Attempting to build relatability or universality by stripping away the ways we are embodied and experience the world as humans does not always (or, I would argue, usually) make for the most emotionally resonant stories.”<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Emotionally resonant stories are one thing. But beyond literary merits, is the absence of girl animals in kid’s books really that serious? Does it actually impact how kids develop and see the world?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Yes, says Megan Fulcher, a professor of cognitive and behavior psychology at Washington & Lee University, who focuses on gender role development and toy play in children. “Differences in representation really matter no matter if characters are human or animals,” Fulcher said. This absence not only provides girls with few models, but it also prevents boys from practicing cognitive skills like empathy, from having the opportunity to “think about what it’s like to be someone else.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Fulcher and her lab have found the same problem in kid’s toys. “Boy toys” like action figures and Legos often include few or no female characters, which makes “women and girls invisible in boys’ pretend play” and leaves their imaginative worlds “void of girls.” This matters because imaginative play is crucial for developing relational skills and empathy.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->If we apply this logic to picture books, the picture is rather bleak. Because animal characters don’t just obscure girls and women, they obscure all kinds of human difference. For example, a UK study found that there were more animal protagonists in British kid’s books than there were Black, Asian, or ethnic minority human protagonists. And recently, animal characters have been used to represent transgender people and their experiences, which Parrish Turner argues can fall flat or worse: “[T]here is a marked difference between wanting to be another gender, considering the range and complexity of human gender, and wanting to be another species, something that is impossible.”<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->So much for sidestepping human problems. Animal characters don’t just reflect our biases—they often deepen them.<!----></p><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></section><section id="ladies"><!--[!--><!--[--><!--[2--><!----><h2><!---->Why are cats, birds, and ladybugs… ladies?<!----><!----></h2><!----><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But if animal characters are assumed to be male by default, that still leaves a deeper question. Why do we gender certain animals in certain ways more than others—like cats and birds as female, or bears, wolves, dogs, and frogs as male?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->It’s likely the result of a rich and long-simmering cultural soup: a mix of projected human stereotypes, symbolic associations, hard-coded linguistic habits, and famous media characters, with just a sprinkling of historical quirks to taste.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Large, strong animals like bears and wolves are often coded as masculine, while small, delicate animals like birds or kittens are more easily read as feminine. Frogs are slimy, loud, and gross… kind of like boys?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->There are also countless folk tales, stories, and cultural metaphors that connect certain animals with gender, some of them dating back hundreds or thousands of years.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->While of course there are famous boy cats—think Garfield, Felix, Puss in Boots—cats have been linked to femininity for a long time. They were linked to goddesses in ancient Egypt, to witches in medieval Europe, and more recently to figures like the lonely “cat lady” and the now TikTok famous “black cat girlfriend”—a term for a standoffish, introverted, sometimes mean girlfriend who is best paired with a “golden retriever” partner.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(tiktok)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Birds, too, carry associations with femininity. You can think of the caged bird as a metaphor for constrained womanhood, or all the women who get transformed into birds in Greek mythology.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->These animalistic analogies sometimes get embedded into the slang and colloquialisms we use everyday, even across languages like English and Spanish. As scholar Irene López Rodríguez reminds us, we call men “studs, bucks, wolves, toros (bulls), zorros (foxes) and linces (lynxes),” and we call women “chick, bird, kitten, pollita (chicken) or gatita (kitten).” “The choice of the animal name does not seem arbitrary,” she says, “but, on the contrary, may shed some light onto the expectations and beliefs society holds about males and females.”<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Thinking beyond English also raises an important question: Does language influence how we perceive the gender of animals?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Some languages, like Spanish or French, have grammatical gender, where all nouns are gendered, even inanimate ones like “la mesa” (the table). In Spanish, many animals can be either masculine or feminine, such as the cat—el gato or la gata. But others, like the frog—la rana—are always grammatically feminine.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->So are Spanish speakers more likely to perceive frogs as girls?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Though we’d need another study to know for sure, some research suggests: maybe? There are definitely Spanish children’s books with girl frogs in starring roles—like Olga de Dios’s Rana de Tres Ojos or Mar Benegas’s La Rana Mariana busca toda la semana.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But Spanish speakers also find creative ways to work around grammatical gender. The famous Muppets character Kermit the Frog is masculinized through the addition of a traditionally male name—La Rana René in Mexico and Latin America, or La Rana Gustavo in Spain. And the Spanish translation of Frog and Toad Are Friends uses a totally made up word, sepo—Sapo y Sepo son Amigos—to describe the iconic frog in slacks and distinguish him from his sapo (toad) bestie. Still, it might not be a coincidence that both these examples are already famous male frogs imported from English.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Ladybugs are another intriguing case. Ladybugs appear in four different books in our dataset, and are gendered female 75% of the time. Are ladybugs “ladies” in all languages?<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Surprisingly, in many of them, yes. In the English language, the word ladybird—that’s what the Brits call ladybugs—and ladycow, another common term, originated around the 1600s. “Lady” was a reference to “Our Lady,” the Virgin Mary, apparently because both the beetle and the Holy Mother like to wear red. Ladybugs were also considered somewhat holy because they devour the pests that plague farmers and gardeners (yes, they’re carnivores).<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->The name spread—likely alongside colonialism. In The History of the Ladybird: With Some Diversions of This and That (1989), A.W. Exell documents 329 names for ladybugs in 55 languages. A full quarter of them are linked to the Virgin Mary.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(chart)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->In German, the ladybug is Marienkäfer (“Mary’s beetle”); in Spanish, Mariquita (“little Mary”); in Norwegian and Danish, Mariahøne and Mariehøne respectively (“Mary’s hen”); in Italian, regional names include la gallinella della Madonna (“Madonna’s little hen”); in Macedonian, kalinka na Bogorodica (“ladybug of the Virgin Mary”); and in Icelandic, Maríubjalla (“Mary’s bell”). Weirdly, many other ladybug names have religious connotations, like “God’s little cow,” which appears in Russian (bozhya korovka) and Polish (boża krówka).<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->This reveals how the gendering of animals can be both arbitrary and deeply culturally ingrained. What began as, let’s face it, a kind of random symbolic association steadily became, over multiple centuries of a big game of “telephone,” the ladybug’s gendered destiny in many parts of the human world. So while language definitely shapes how we view animals and the world around us, there are other powerful forces at work, too. Like those historical big guns: religion and empire.<!----></p><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></section><section id="weird"><!--[!--><!--[--><!--[2--><!----><h2><!---->Weirder, Wilder, Less Predictable<!----><!----></h2><!----><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->The arbitrariness of our gendered associations with certain animals, like the ladybug, is kind of inspiring in its own weird way. Sure, it’s shocking and a little depressing to realize just how much our mental maps are shaped by British colonists and Catholic iconography from 400 years ago. But it also means those maps can be redrawn.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Things aren’t going to change overnight. In our analysis, we found no clear progress toward equal gender representation in animal characters from 1950 to today. And when I asked Fulcher if things might be improving, she didn’t mince words: “No.” Her lab recently found that gendered traits in toys have barely budged in the past 30 years, so it wasn’t surprising that books reflected the same stagnation.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->As she reminded us, it takes time to move the needle: “Parents provide books to kids that may be new or old so it will take a minute to trickle into kids’ lives even if the gap disappears today.”<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Still, while broad patterns haven’t shifted, we did find plenty of meaningful exceptions. Take pigs, for example. In the mid- and late-twentieth century, pigs were more commonly coded as male—thanks in part to iconic characters like the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->But by the late 1990s and early 2000s, pigs took a strong feminine turn. Think of Laura Joffe Numeroff’s If You Give a Pig a Pancake (1998), Ian Falconer’s Olivia (2000), or Mo Willems’s Elephant & Piggie series, where pig characters are not only female but confident, curious, and central to their stories.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->(img)<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->What’s more, there are thousands of kid’s books that are not in our dataset. We focus here on the very most popular books, but a lot of parents intentionally seek out books beyond the mainstream—typically the most conservative cultural sector and the slowest to change. Outside the spotlight, in indie and lesser-known titles, animal characters are hopefully getting weirder, wilder, and less predictable.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->That’s still one advantage we have over large language models. We have the power to change our own training data.<!----></p><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></section><section id="methods"><!--[!--><!--[--><!--[2--><!----><h2><!---->Data and Methods<!----><!----></h2><!----><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->To identify picture books from the last 100+ years that feature anthropomorphic animals, we first compiled a general dataset of picture books, emphasizing picture books that have been popular among readers in the 21st century. We collected information about books that were either *tagged* the most as a “picture book” on Goodreads or compiled into a *list* of well-known picture books by decade on Goodreads. We then supplemented this data with picture books that appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for children’s picture books (between June 2008 when the list started and August 2024 when we collected data) and picture books that were tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database at Miami University.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->To identify picture books that specifically feature animals, we then selected any picture book that had “animals” as one of its top Goodreads tags; any picture book that was tagged as “animals” in the Children’s Book Database; or any book that GPT-4o identified as featuring animals (after being prompted with its title, author, and description — see example prompt and response below). We manually evaluate each book and each representation of animals, and we use the above criteria as a culling method for reducing a large dataset to a manageable size. We also excluded anthologies and collections, such as Grimm’s Fairy Tales.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->For our manual evaluation, we identified an animal as anthropomorphic if 1) **the animal exists (or existed) in the real world; 2a) the animal is an active subject at some point in the book; 2b) the animal has dialogue or is an important character to the story; 3) the animal has at least one anthropomorphic quality (**e.g., clothing, speech, upright walking, jobs, personality, uses tools, facial expressions, complex relationships, cultural behavior, lives in house, etc.). We excluded animals that were only referred to as a group or in a plural form (e.g, “… said the birds”, “the squirrels jumped”); other exclusions….<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->We identified the gender of the animal based on the pronouns used to refer to the animal in the text of the picture book: she/her; he/him; they/them; it; [animal name]; n/a. In some cases, animals were not referred to by pronouns, but they were described using gendered honorifics (e.g., Ms. Eel, Mr. Camel) or gendered familial relations (mother, sister, father, brother). In these cases, we tagged the animal with the common gender associated with the honorific or familial role in a human context (e.g., "Ms." as female, "father" as male), while recognizing that these associations are culturally specific and may not reflect the full diversity of gender identities. We acknowledge that these choices impose human-centric and binary gender norms onto characters that might otherwise be interpreted with more flexibility or ambiguity.<!----></p><!--]--><!--[1--><p><!---->Add a note about the minimal animal grouping that we did: cat and kitten, dog and puppy, bunny, rabbit, hare.
