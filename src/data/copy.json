Across 300 popular books from the past 70+ years, there were some clear patterns. Frogs were overwhelmingly boys. Birds were girls. Pigs leaned a little male but were slowly moving into their Girl Boss era."},{"type":"text","value":"Our findings sparked a heated discussion on social media, especially among those who speak languages beyond English. Many people perceived these animals differently."},{"type":"text","value":"“Really funny to read this as someone speaking French, a Language Where Everything is Gendered,” one commenter said. “Obviously birds are hes and frogs are shes, what do you mean (haha).”"},{"type":"text","value":"It’s a great point. Language definitely shapes the way we imagine animals, totally separate from reality or biology. And that may be especially true for <b>Languages Where Everything Is Gendered</b>—aka languages with <i>grammatical</i> gender, where nouns (including animals) are assigned a masculine, feminine, or sometimes neuter gender."},{"type":"text","value":"We acknowledged this point in our original story, but you made it clear: for many of you, grammatical gender <i>really</i> shapes your imagined sense of an animal’s gender, even when it’s a made-up character in a kid’s story."},{"type":"text","value":"So we wanted to do a quick breakdown of how 10 different languages—Arabic, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish—gender 14 different animals. How do these animals match up? And how do they compare to our English-language findings?"},{"type":"h2","value":"Animal Face-Off"},{"type":"text","value":"Let’s start with frogs.

And, in fact, it’s often very arbitrary (in French, the word vagina <i>le vagin</i> is grammatically masculine ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯). So even if the word for an animal is grammatically feminine, it doesn’t mean that animal will always be represented as female—or, in the case of anthropomorphic characters, as a girl or a woman."},{"type":"text","value":"For example, in Spanish, where frogs are always grammatically feminine (<em>la rana</em>), you still find dude frogs.
